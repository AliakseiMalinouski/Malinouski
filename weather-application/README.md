### A short description of the project

The application is developed on functional components and hooks. The data model is based on Redux, all the required data is downloaded from the server and installed in Slices and later used in the components. The weather data is queried from an open source which provides the weather data. The application adapts to the time of day by changing the theme of the entire application. The weather icons above the region name also change based on the temperature of the particular region.
